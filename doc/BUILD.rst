trace Developers Guide
=========================

To initialize your build environment following an initial checkout, or
to reset it for some other reason, you should run the ``bootstrap``
script.

To configure your build for the host OS platform, set compiler
options, and choose optional build features, you should run the
``configure`` script (generated by ``bootstrap``).  ``configure
--help`` describes its many options.

To compile and link the main executable, your should run ``make`` (after
having run ``bootstrap`` and ``configure``).  You do not need to
re-bootstrap and re-configure for each build.

To run the unit tests, run ``make check``.

To build the RPM package, run ``script/build.sh``.
